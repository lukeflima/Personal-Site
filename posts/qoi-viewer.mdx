## QOI - The "Quit OK Image Format"

The "Quit OK Image Format" or QOI is a image format that was created to offer a lossless compression format with a faster encoding time and better compression rates while being simple and small.

I decided to create this decoder trying to learn how the format works and also learning how to make a WebAssembly using Rust. You can find the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/lukeflima/qoi-viewer).
